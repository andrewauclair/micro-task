# micro task

A CLI based task tracking application. Designed to be efficient and as fast as possible for tracking tasks,
but not getting in the way.

Includes the ability to add, start, stop and finish tasks. Tasks can be organized into lists and groups.

See the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/mightymalakai33/micro-task/-/wikis/home) or [design](design.md) for more details.
